Good change or addition ideas: 

A button on the scan tab to add a result to the compare and purchase history/record purchases endpoints = convenient

Make the brand a text box on all relevant enpoints, not just for scan which you already did.  

Make the barcode work by itself like it does on the Open Food Facts app

Let users add products to the database

On the compare tab, allow comparison of all existing and added brands in the db bloc of the app.py

On the compare tab, change the radio buttons for brand selections into a text search box to add up to X brands to compare at one time
