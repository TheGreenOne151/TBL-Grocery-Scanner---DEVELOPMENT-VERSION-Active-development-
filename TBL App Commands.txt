**********************************

Good change or addition ideas: 

A button on the scan tab to add a result to the compare and purchase history/record purchases endpoints = convenient

Make the brand a text box on all relevant enpoints, not just for scan which you already did.  

Make the barcode work by itself like it does on the Open Food Facts app

Let users add products to the database

On the compare tab, allow comparison of all existing and added brands in the db bloc of the app.py

On the compare tab, change the radio buttons for brand selections into a text search box to add up to X brands to compare at one time

Git

For Github and Render sync: 

# Navigate to your project
cd C:\Users\StardogChampion\tbl-grocery-app

# Initialize git (if not already)
git init

# Check what files will be added
git status

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: FastAPI app for Render"

# Connect to GitHub (use your URL from Step 1)
git remote add origin https://github.com/TheGreenOne151/TBL_Grocery_Scanner.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# First push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

************************************

Git

1. Local → GitHub (Upload)
When you edit files locally and want them on GitHub:

bash
git add .
git commit -m "My changes"
git push  # ← This UPLOADS to GitHub
2. GitHub → Local (Download)
When there are changes on GitHub that you want locally:

bash
git pull  # ← This DOWNLOADS from GitHub

Important Scenarios:
If you edit directly on GitHub.com:
Changes stay only on GitHub

To get them locally: git pull

If you edit locally:
Changes stay only on your computer

To send to GitHub: git add ., git commit -m "message", git push

To avoid conflicts:
Always do this before starting work:

bash
git pull
This ensures you have the latest version from GitHub.

Editing on GitHub.com directly:
You can edit files directly on GitHub.com, but then you must remember to:

On your local computer: git pull to get those changes

Otherwise, you'll have different versions on GitHub vs. your computer

Best practice:
Pick one workflow:

Either: Always edit locally, then push to GitHub

Or: Edit on GitHub.com, then immediately pull to your computer

Mixing both without pull/push will cause version conflicts.

Remember:
git push = Send my changes to GitHub

git pull = Get changes from GitHub

No automatic sync - you control when to sync


********************************

Workflow --

I use Atom and Powershell for now. I would like to save changes locally using Atom app and then push them to Git in Powershell. Good, right?
Perfect! Yes, that's an excellent workflow. You've chosen the most common and reliable approach used by developers:

Your Ideal Workflow:
text
Atom (Edit files) → Save locally → PowerShell (Git commands) → GitHub
Step-by-Step Process:
1. Edit in Atom:
Open your project folder in Atom

Make changes to files

Save (Ctrl+S) - files are saved to your computer

2. Push via PowerShell:
powershell
cd C:\Users\StardogChampion\tbl-grocery-app
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push
Why this is GREAT:
✅ No surprises - You see changes locally first
✅ Easy to test - Run your app locally before pushing
✅ Version control - Each commit is a save point you can revert to
✅ Backup - GitHub becomes your backup in the cloud

To delete files from local project folder and then commit and push to Github --

Complete example:
Let's say you deleted old_file.py and unused_data.txt:

powershell
# 1. See what changed
git status

# 2. Stage the deletions
git add old_file.py unused_data.txt

# 3. Or stage ALL deletions and changes
git add -A

# 4. Commit
git commit -m "Cleaned up: removed old_file.py and unused_data.txt"

# 5. Push
git push

Alternative - One-liner:
powershell
git add -A && git commit -m "Removed unused files" && git push
Important: Use git add -A for deletions
git add . - Adds new/modified files in current directory

git add -A - Adds ALL changes (new, modified, AND deleted files)

For deletions, git add -A is safest.

***************************

Key commands you now know:
Command	Purpose	Example
git status	Check what changed	Always run first
git add -A	Stage all changes (adds/deletes)	git add -A
git commit -m "msg"	Save changes with message	git commit -m "Fixed bug"
git push	Upload to GitHub	git push
git pull	Download from GitHub	git pull
